- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike B.
- 👀 I’m interested in 1. perl and 2. presenting complex data sets using mysql, php, javascript
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to figure why I can create a multilevel data object in a perl script but can't read JSON from a file into a hash in Windows 10. What perl module will do this?
- 💞️ I’m looking for help on above and help in developing http://www.koreanwargraphs.byethost7.com/ajax.orig.html in a more professional manner. Thanks.
